## Features

- üîê Solana wallet integration (Phantom, Solflare, Backpack)
- üìä Create and manage voting polls
- üë• Add candidates to polls
- üó≥Ô∏è Cast multiple votes (D21 voting system)
- üì± Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Solana CLI tools
- A Solana wallet (Phantom, Solflare, or Backpack)
- Solana devnet SOL for testing

## Setup

### Option 1: Use the Live Version

The easiest way to try the application is to visit the [live demo](https://d21voting.vercel.app/) and connect your Solana wallet.

### Option 2: Run Locally

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration:**
   The app is configured to use Solana devnet by default. You can change this in `lib/solana.ts`:

   ```typescript
   export const NETWORK = clusterApiUrl("devnet"); // Change to 'mainnet-beta' for production
   ```

3. **Program ID:**
   The program ID is configured in `lib/solana.ts`. Make sure it matches your deployed program:
   ```typescript
   export const PROGRAM_ID = "2CNQMKvkPPfgiZFKJar6gyWc6bquTV2jW7NEHMfynLBs";
   ```

## Development

1. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. **Connect your wallet:**
   Click the "Connect Wallet" button and select your preferred Solana wallet

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Wallet not connecting:**
   - Ensure you have a Solana wallet extension installed
   - Check that you're on the correct network (devnet/testnet/mainnet)

2. **Transaction failures:**
   - Verify you have sufficient SOL for transaction fees
   - Check the browser console for detailed error messages
   - Ensure the program is deployed to the correct network

3. **Program not found:**
   - Verify the PROGRAM_ID matches your deployed program
   - Check that the program is deployed to the current network

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by checking the browser console for detailed transaction and program interaction logs.
